File merging powered with [Dmerge.js](https://github.com/KucingKode/Dmerge)

## ðŸ¤” What Is This

Cithak is a **simple, secure yet powerful template manager** CLI. Cithak can merge two templates by merge configuration files from those templates and Cithak was designed to be safe and transparent, so everything will be done under your permission.

## ðŸ“š Motivation

Cithak was created because sometimes **a template will broke other templates and templates are difficult to manage or combine**. We solve this problem by give Cithak ability to merge readme and configuration files and ability to clone templates from github, gitlab, bitbucket, or your local storage with just simple CLI

## ðŸ’» Features

- ### **Secure**

  Cithak will log every activities and execute every tasks that you **give permission to execute**, or you can disable task execution with `--no-exec` flag

- ### **Smart**

  Cithak can **do more than overwrite your files**, it can give index or merge data from two [mergeable files](#mergeable-files) like `.json`, `.yaml`, `.env` and some other configuration files, you can disable this feature with `--no-merge` flag

- ### **Flexible**

  Cithak can **use template from anywhere**, clone templates from your local storage, github, gitlab, or bitbucket using git. You can use cithak with or without internet connection

## ðŸ“‚ Installation

- Node.js

```bash
npm install -g cithak
```

- Windows, Linux, Mac

To use Cithak on Windows, Linux, or Mac without node js, download the latest executable for your operating system from [releases](https://github.com/KucingKode/Cithak/releases)

  To save a template just go to your template and type `cth save [template-name]`
